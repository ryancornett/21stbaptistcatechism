			"originalQuestion": "What doth the conclusion of the Lord's prayer teach?",
			"originalAnswer": "The conclusion of the Lord's prayer, which is, For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen, 1 teacheth us to take our encouragement in prayer from God only, 2 and in our prayers to praise Him, ascribing kingdom, power, and glory, to Him. 3 And in testimony of our desire and assurance to be heard, we say, Amen. 4"
